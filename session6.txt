SESSION 6: Django

In this workshop, we'll walk through creating a web app with Django.

Django is a Python-powered web framework that makes it really easy and fast to get a website
up and running. They also have fantastic documentation, so we'll be walking through the
official Django tutorial!

To get started, create a new Django workspace in Cloud9. C9 has Django already installed,
so if you try and do this on your local machine, you'll need to download and install it
before following the tutorial.

To customize your web pages, try checking the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tutorials at the 
W3 Schools website.
